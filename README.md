# Sketchdance Shimmy

Shimmy is intended as a super-simple line drawing animation program for quick sketch animations. 

It is a part of a larger, more ambitious Sketchdance project that is in progress, in part for Richmond Public Library (some of the work pre-dates my employment there and some of the Sketchdance projects exist entirely outside of it).

Some docs, known bugs, and todo list are in the main [design document](https://hackmd.io/_d_YffpgRu2vVVTFbPjDZg?view).
